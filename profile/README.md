## Welcome to CANOPY 👋

We help build business tools for all ages.

We're building in public to create business tools and systems that last.

That's why we started our coding by re-thinking the "Virtual Contact File" format.

We are researching what a Business OS would look like that could power small devices.

To get our feet wet and meet a very large need for simpler business records, we are starting off by making Workpads. It's a modular system for business records based on the fundamentals of trade and exchange - debt!
